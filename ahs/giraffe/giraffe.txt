Hi! My name is Giraffe.
I was found as a stray, so I came to Animal Humane Society to find a new home.

People describe me as playful. Playful dogs enjoy playing with toys and often enjoy other busy interactions. We may like a good game of fetch or just quietly chewing on a stuffed animal. No matter which toys we choose, we prefer to include our families in the fun.

People also describe me as energetic. Energetic dogs love to be busy, both physically and mentally. We often enjoy seeing and doing new things with our families and are often best matched with active people. Energetic dogs do best in homes that can provide them adequate exercise and mental stimulation, such as running, hiking, or playing Frisbee.

Lived with children: No
